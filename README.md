# Mechman vs Slimes
 
 This is a wave-based top down survival 2D shooter, where the player controls a robot (Mechman!) on treads with a variety of weaponry to use against slime enemies. 
 
 # Brief Project History
 
 This game was initially created in 2017 by two inexperienced highschool programmers, Braeden Worcester and Steven Mendiola. It has received occasional updates from both, but is for the most part as it was when the school year concluded in 2018. Resultingly, much of the code is "messy" to say the least.
 
 # Features
 
 - Move Mechman in eight directions with WASD.
 - Aim Mechman's weapons with the mouse cursor, and hold left click to fire.
 - Swap through Mechman's weapons with number row keys 1 through 6.
 - Move Mechman over powerups to obtain more ammo, become briefly "supercharged" (invincibility, infinite ammo, faster movement, more rapid firerate), restore health,   and deploy auto turrets (press middle mouse to deploy after picking up).
 - Enemy slimes go in a straight line to Mechman, upon collision Mechman will take damage and the slime will die.
 - After every slime is dead, a new larger wave of slimes will appear.
 - Activate hardcore mode from the main menu: Faster slimes, and Mechman will die in one hit.

# Todo
- Implement sounds (volume slider is currently nonfunctional).
- Reimplement alternate fire modes on right click.
- Implement an extra ranged enemy.
- Fix bullet speed consistency.
- Implement broader resolution support (game requires 1920x1080 to play normally as of now)

This project is currently in Unity Editor version 2020.3.1*
